\Thank you for installing the Data Ingest application!

To verify your application is running, check the pods in the default namespace:

kubectl get pods -l app={{ .Release.Name }}

To check the service status, you can run:

kubectl get service {{ .Release.Name }}

Access the application via the exposed service or ingress (if enabled).
